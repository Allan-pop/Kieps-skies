*Paradigm Shifts and Methodologies*  
**Development Methodologies**  
- Waterfall model (1970s): A linear, sequential approach  
- Agile manifesto (2001): Response to heavyweight documentation-driven processes  
- Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban  
- DevOps (late 2000s): Breaking down silos between development and operations  
- *Resource: Agile Manifesto*  

**Architectural Evolution**  
- Monolithic applications → Service-oriented architecture → Microservices

- Cross-platform development: Write once, run anywhere  
- API economy: Services communicating through well-defined interfaces  
- Low-code/No-code platforms emerging  

**Industry Trends**  
- AI/ML integration into development workflows  
- Edge computing gaining importance  
- DevSecOps: Security as part of the development process

**Part 2: Different Development Paths**  
*Frontend Development*  
**Evolution**  
- Static HTML (early 1990s)  
- CSS introduced (1996)  
- JavaScript becomes ubiquitous (late 1990s)  
- AJAX enables dynamic content without page reloads (early 2000s)  
- Responsive design for multiple devices (2010s)  
- Single Page Applications become dominant  

**Key Technologies**  
- Core languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  
- Modern frameworks:  
  - React (by Facebook) - component-based UI  
  - Angular (by Google) - full-featured framework  
  - Vue.js - progressive framework  
- State management: Redux, Context API, Vuex  
- CSS approaches: SASS/SCSS, CSS-in-JS, Tailwind CSS

- Go: Performance-focused, cloud-native applications  
- PHP: Powers ~79% of websites, WordPress  
- Ruby: Developer happiness with Rails framework  
- C#/.NET: Microsoft ecosystem  

**Database Technologies**  
- Relational (SQL): PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle  
- NoSQL:  
  - Document stores: MongoDB, Couchbase  
  - Key-value stores: Redis, DynamoDB  
  - Column-family: Cassandra  
  - Graph databases: Neo4j  
- NewSQL: CockroachDB, Google Spanner  

**Backend Concepts**  
- RESTful API design  
- GraphQL as an alternative to REST  
- Authentication & authorization  
- Caching strategies  
- Horizontal scaling  
- *Resource: Backend Developer Roadmap*  
- *Tool: Postman for API Development*  

*Full-Stack Development*  
**The Full-Stack Role**  
- Definition: Developers working across both frontend and backend  
- T-shaped skills: Deep in one area, broad knowledge in many  
- Advantages: End-to-end understanding, smaller teams possible  
- Challenges: Keeping up with rapid changes on both sides  

**Popular Full-Stack Combinations**  
- MEAN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js  
- MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
